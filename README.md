This repository contains scripts used to analyze the impact of the Los Angeles wildfires using a two-stage interrupted time series design. The following sections describe data sources and scripts used for the analysis. The codes have been adapted from the following study:

              Two-Stage Interrupted Time Series Analysis with Machine Learning: Evaluating the Health Effects of the 2018 Wildfire Smoke Event in San Francisco County as a Case Study
              Authors: Arnab K. Dey, Yiqun Ma, Gabriel Carrasco-Escobar, Changwoo Han, Fran√ßois Rerolle, Tarik Benmarhnia

## Data Sources
Data from this analysis comes from multiple sources:
-Wildfire boundaries from CALFIRE (CALFIRE. Current Emergency Incidents. https://www.fire.ca.gov/Incidents. Published 425 2025. Accessed 19 Jan 2025)
-Daily virtual and outpatient visits from Kaiser Permanente for five disease categories using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes (all-cause, cardiovascular [I00-I99], injury [S00-T88], neuropsychiatric [F01-F99], and respiratory [J00-J99]). We aggregated visits by type, cause, day, and wildfire exposure category.
-Daily maximum and minimum temperature and humidity, wind velocity, and surface downward shortwave radiation from gridMET (
-Daily weekly wastewater surveillance data on flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2. (Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. RESPWatch: Respiratory Illness Surveillance. http://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/#Viruses. Accessed 02/12/2025.)

## Data Dictionary

This section describes the variables present in the datasets used in the study. We use two datasets df-train-test-sf.csv and df-predict.csv. These datasets correspond to the pre-event period and the entire study period including the post-event period.

-df-train-test-sf.csv is used to train the models, to perform crossvalidation, and to evaluate model performance.
-df-predict.csv is used to predict hospitalizations under the counterfactual scenario.

## Data Analysis Scripts

# Prep Script
1.0-ITS-prep.R
This scripts prepares the data for the modelling.

# Modelling Scripts

1.1-model-tune-phyxgb.R 
This script configures, tunes, and fits a Prophet-XGBoost model to the aggregated data. It combines Facebook Prophet for trend/seasonality with XGBoost for residuals, using a space-filling grid of 100 combinations.

2.1-model-error-metrics.R
This script loads the modeltime table and calculates training and testing errors. 

# Output generation scripts

3.1-func-generate-MC-CIs.R
This script contains functions to generate confidence intervals for time series forecasts.

3.2-model-forecast.R
This script fits the model from the selected method to the entire data (including post wildfire data) and generates forecasts for the entire dataset with bootstrapped confidence intervals.

3.3-outputs-table-excess-hosp.R
This script computes the excess hospitalizations due to the wildfire and saves as a table.

3.4-func-plot-counterfactuals.R
This script contains functions to plot counterfactual and actual trends.

3.5-outputs-plot-counterfactuals.R
This script applies the function above and saves plots
